Install a dishwasher. This is important because a dishwasher uses water and electricity which have to be connected safely. No one likes to have poorly connected pipes that leak. 

(1) replacing an existing dishwasher in the same location, or
(2) getting a new one installed at a site that has already been fully fitted to accommodate a dishwasher. 

dishwasher needs a dedicated circuit run from the electrical service panel (breaker box). It also needs a source of hot water and a drain.
